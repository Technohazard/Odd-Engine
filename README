Description:
Project and repository created to learn Python, PyGame, and Git.
All the fun game design stuff comes later - right now I just want a nice engine framework.

Future updates and planned features:
- Scrolling background object
- auto-compute speed based on difference between self and target rect
- object 'behaviors' - event-based object messaging
- point-based object pathing 
- collision? May not be necessary for RPG engine, but could easily be repurposed for other games
    may also be used for easy animation scripting
- character animations
    - use pygame Sprite class?
    - 
- combat!
    - once animations are complete, add a combat layer
    - sync combat attacks to simple animations
